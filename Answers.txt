Define Software Engineering:
Ans: Its a branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing and maintainance of software applications.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Ans: It also depicts processes in the case of loosely or tightly-coupled systems before systems are developed. SDLC on the other hand, is a step by step process of developing a software. It include the following phases such as: planning, analysis, design, development, testing, implementation, and maintenance.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Ans: Agile software development refers to project management methodologies that help dev teams deliver high-quality end results
     The waterfall model is a linear, sequential approach to the software development lifecycle (SDLC) that is popular in software engineering 

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering
Ans: Agile software development refers to project management methodologies that help dev teams deliver high-quality end results
     The waterfall model is a linear, sequential approach to the software development lifecycle (SDLC) that is popular in software engineering 

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Ans:  Is the process of defining, documenting and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
Ans:  Is the measuere of the structure of networks or graphs which measures the strength of division of a network into modules. Network with hihg modularity have ense connections between nodes with modules

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
Ans: Unit test: Is the3 type of testing where all functions are tested
     Intergation testing is the kind of testing where by test is done in a whole module not as per functions
     System testing is the type of testing where a scrirpt isc written to check if the system requirements
     acceptance tecting is the type of testing where test is written to check if the system runs correctly


What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
Ans:  version control system is a software that helps developers in managing projects from different people eg. For a company where it has people working from front end to backend version control sysstem helps them in managing the code and also reducing thetime spent in debugging

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
Ans: he is incharge of planning, executing monitoing and closing project of a team choosen to work on a certain project, some of the challenges are some people are not collaborative in the work group.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
Ans:  Software maintainance is the process where the software is updated or maintaned and updated to ensure it remains in the market for a long thetime

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ans: Ethical issues that software engineers may face inlcude privacy, accuracy , accesability and effects on a wuality life.
